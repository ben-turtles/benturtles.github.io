                <p class="inner-text">Hello Agent, and thank you for being patient. The lead I mentioned the other day
                    has to do with a new product that has entered the pharmaceutical environment, known as violatus
                    eternity. It is supposedly an extreme cure all for anyone who ingests it, and is likely the
                    strongest medicine to ever exist. Unfortunately an up and coming pharmaceutical company by the
                    name of Lazarus Biotech has their grimy mitts on the violet, and wants to milk the product for all
                    the cash they can. They have even gone out of their way to hire a man by the name of Ivor
                    Helmsworth, one of the most brilliant scientists in the United States. Under no circumstances can
                    they be allowed to have the violet, so here is the plan. We have intercepted a <a href="../Transmission/transmission.html" class="link">phone call</a> between
                    Ivor and a fellow Lazarus employee. The phone call seems to hint at a meeting location between the
                    two, after which Ivor will likely head back to the location of his lab where the violet is held.
                    Trail him from the meeting point to the lab he heads towards, and write down the location in which
                    he disappears at. <b style="color:red;">DO NOT FOLLOW HIM FURTHER</b>. A man such as Ivor is likely
                    to leave his lab heavily booby trapped, and anyone without proper experience could get themselves
                    hurt. You will simply gather the intelligence, and we will conduct the heist.</p>
