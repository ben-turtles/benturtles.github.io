                We have intercepted a phone call between Ivor and a fellow Lazarus employee. The phone call seems to hint at a meeting location between the
                two, after which Ivor will likely head back to the location of his lab where the violet is held.
                Trail him from the meeting point to the lab he heads towards, and write down the location in which
                he disappears at. <b style="color:red;">DO NOT FOLLOW HIM FURTHER</b>. A man such as Ivor is likely
                to leave his lab heavily booby trapped, and anyone without proper experience could get themselves
                hurt. You will simply gather the intelligence, and we will conduct the heist.</p>
