                        For too long our world has been molded to the whims of the rich, the powerful, and the greedy. Our Earth suffers – choked by air pollution, scarred by deforestation, weakened by soil degradation, and poisoned by plastic and radioactive waste – all due to mankind’s ignorance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="inner-text">
                        We have been robbed of an optimistic future. Our cultures uprooted and stripped of their sense of community, corrupted by materialistic notions of riches, beauty, and status.
                    </p>
                    <p class="inner-text">
                        But as members of OSEN – as solarpunks – we remain hopeful. Through activism, community, and above all, hope, we believe a harmonious future is within reach.

                <ol class="inner-text">
                    <li>We are solarpunks because optimism has been taken away from us and we are trying to take it back.</li>
                    <li>We are solarpunks because the only other options are denial or despair.</li>
                    <li>At its core, Solarpunk is a vision of a future that embodies the best of what humanity can achieve: a post-scarcity, post-hierarchy, post-capitalist world where humanity sees itself as part of nature and clean energy replaces fossil fuels.</li>
                    <li>The “punk” in Solarpunk is about rebellion, counterculture, post-capitalism, neocolonialism and enthusiasm.</li>
                    <li>Solarpunk emphasizes environmental sustainability and social justice.</li>
                    <li>Solarpunk is about finding ways to make life more wonderful for us right now, and also for the generations that follow us.</li>
                    <li>Our future must involve repurposing and creating new things from what we already have.</li>
                    <li>Solarpunk wants to counter the scenarios of a dying earth, an insuperable gap between rich and poor, and a society controlled by corporations. Not in hundreds of years, but within reach.</li>
                    <li>Solarpunk is about youth maker culture, local solutions, local energy grids, ways of creating autonomous functioning systems. It is about loving the world.</li>
                    <li>We will no longer be overlords. We will be caretakers. We will be gardeners.</li>

If you are reading this, it’s likely that you have just passed initialization into our society. Aid in our acts of protest and activism where possible, and hold on tightly to hope. It is the seed of revolution.
Our future counts on you.”
